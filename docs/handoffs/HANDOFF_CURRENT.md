# Handoff — Current

> Update every session (it's part of Definition of Done — see CLAUDE.md). Keep
> short and truthful. Sections below are the mandated HANDOFF standard.

**Last updated:** 2026-06-06

## Current status
Web app **live in production** (Vercel → `www.remynest.com`). **Delete Account
shipped and validated** end-to-end. Single authoritative workflow established in
`CLAUDE.md` (Investigation/Execution modes).

## Completed work
- **Launch hardening** (merged to `main`): Playwright security automation, AI
  disclaimers, premium 402, GDPR export, legal pages, CRON_SECRET, `/api/health`,
  error-message sanitisation, Sentry wiring + error boundaries.
- **Core product**: memory CRUD + AI enrichment/embeddings, reminders, semantic
  search, memory chat, insights, caregiver sharing, Stripe subscriptions, GDPR export.
- **Settings v1** (`/settings`): account info, export, privacy links, Delete Account.
- **Delete Account — DONE**: migration applied; tombstone provisioned
  (`TOMBSTONE_USER_ID` set local + Vercel); A–F scenarios **validated PASS** against
  the live DB (own-only, transfer, retain/delete contributed, storage, auth
  recovery). `memories.user_id → auth.users` (CASCADE, NOT NULL) confirmed.
- **Care-profile paywall**: plan-limit no longer crashes — server returns a
  structured result; client opens the upgrade modal (Premium/Family) instead of a
  Server Components error.
- **Account identity single source of truth**: `lib/account-identity.ts`
  (`resolveAccountIdentity`) now feeds both `/settings` and the app-layout navbar;
  removed hardcoded placeholder identity from `AppNavbar`/`UserProfileDropdown`.
  Settings and navbar always show the same account/plan.
- **Workspace context visibility**: persistent color-coded `WorkspaceIndicator`
  in the navbar + Care-mode `WorkspaceBanner` (active profile + "Switch to My
  Nest"), resolved in `(app)/layout.tsx` from the existing active-context cookie.
  Workspace switches now `revalidatePath("/", "layout")` so all routes reflect
  the change immediately. No new workspace system introduced.
- **FAMILY drift fixed (webhook)**: `customer.subscription.updated` no longer
  hardcodes `subscription_plan: "PREMIUM"`. Added `planFromPriceId(priceId)`
  (reverse lookup over `BILLING_PLANS`) and the webhook now derives the plan from
  the Stripe price → FAMILY stays FAMILY across renewals/updates. Unknown price →
  preserve existing plan + `console.warn`; inactive → FREE. checkout (metadata
  plan) and deleted (FREE) paths unchanged; `subscription.created` writes no plan
  (can't downgrade). Verified PREMIUM→PREMIUM, FAMILY→FAMILY.
- **Contact page** (`/contact`, public): General Contact + Enterprise Solutions +
  Investors & Partnerships sections. All emails sourced from `lib/contact.ts`
  (`CONTACT.general`/`enterprise`/`investors` → `contact@`/`enterprise@`/
  `investors@remynest.com` — placeholders, update before launch). Linked from the
  landing footer. No billing/checkout/subscription/Stripe/DB changes.
- **Identity stale-cache fix**: Settings/Navbar showed "Free Member" for a premium
  account because the identity read was served from Next's cache (pre-upgrade row),
  while billing/dashboard bypass caching. Added `noStore()` to
  `resolveAccountIdentity` and `force-dynamic` to `(app)/layout.tsx` so identity is
  always fresh per user.
- **Subscription resolution unified**: `lib/billing/resolve-subscription.ts` is
  the single authoritative resolver (premium if `is_premium` OR status
  active/trialing OR plan PREMIUM/FAMILY) used by `checkPremium`,
  `resolveAccountIdentity`, `/api/billing/status`, and the dashboard. Removed all
  inline plan logic; logs a warning on contradictory rows. Fixes `checkPremium`
  previously mis-gating premium users whose `subscription_plan` was stale `FREE`.
- **Workspace switching repaired** (was architecturally broken): added
  `EnterCareProfileList` (My Nest → Care entry that calls `setActiveProfile` →
  writes `remynest-active-context`); fixed `ProfileSwitcher` guard to use the real
  `activeProfileId` (selecting a profile from PERSONAL now switches); unified the
  account menu to call `setPersonalWorkspace` (removed the divergent `?context=`
  URL system). Single source of truth = the cookie.
- **Deploy fix**: `/api/billing/status` `force-dynamic` (DYNAMIC_SERVER_USAGE).
- **Docs + workflow**: `/docs` system + consolidated `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Mobile**: Capacitor remote-URL wrapper; iOS build verified (`feat/capacitor-mobile`).

## Open issues
- `users` table missing → `save-onesignal` / `save-subscription` broken.
- `/api/stripe/cancel` missing → BillingSection cancel broken.
- Sentry env vars not set in Vercel (no prod error visibility).
- Data drift: the webhook now writes a correct, price-derived `subscription_plan`
  (future drift prevented). **Pre-existing** drifted rows (e.g. `admin@remynest.com`:
  is_premium=true, plan=FREE) are not auto-corrected until their next
  subscription event with a known price — a one-time data reconciliation is still
  advisable. `resolveSubscription` tolerates drift for premium/free.
- Dev uses prod Supabase (no staging); media bucket `memory-media` is public.
- Tech debt: duplicate export logic; two profile render paths; two search
  endpoints; schema not version-controlled; `npm audit` advisories.

## Active branch
`main` (production; auto-deploys). `feat/capacitor-mobile` holds mobile work
(pushed, unmerged).

## Next priorities
P0: fix `/api/stripe/cancel`; fix/remove broken OneSignal endpoints; confirm Sign
in with Apple. P1: set Sentry env in Vercel; native push;
Android build + store submission.

## Blockers
None blocking web production. Mobile store submission blocked on Apple Developer /
Play Console accounts + native push + Android SDK.
