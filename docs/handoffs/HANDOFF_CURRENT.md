# Handoff — Current

> Update every session (it's part of Definition of Done — see CLAUDE.md). Keep
> short and truthful. Sections below are the mandated HANDOFF standard.

**Last updated:** 2026-06-06

## Current status
Web app **live in production** (Vercel → `www.remynest.com`). **Delete Account
shipped and validated** end-to-end. Single authoritative workflow established in
`CLAUDE.md` (Investigation/Execution modes).

## Completed work
- **Launch hardening** (merged to `main`): Playwright security automation, AI
  disclaimers, premium 402, GDPR export, legal pages, CRON_SECRET, `/api/health`,
  error-message sanitisation, Sentry wiring + error boundaries.
- **Core product**: memory CRUD + AI enrichment/embeddings, reminders, semantic
  search, memory chat, insights, caregiver sharing, Stripe subscriptions, GDPR export.
- **Settings v1** (`/settings`): account info, export, privacy links, Delete Account.
- **Delete Account — DONE**: migration applied; tombstone provisioned
  (`TOMBSTONE_USER_ID` set local + Vercel); A–F scenarios **validated PASS** against
  the live DB (own-only, transfer, retain/delete contributed, storage, auth
  recovery). `memories.user_id → auth.users` (CASCADE, NOT NULL) confirmed.
- **Care-profile paywall**: plan-limit no longer crashes — server returns a
  structured result; client opens the upgrade modal (Premium/Family) instead of a
  Server Components error.
- **Account identity single source of truth**: `lib/account-identity.ts`
  (`resolveAccountIdentity`) now feeds both `/settings` and the app-layout navbar;
  removed hardcoded placeholder identity from `AppNavbar`/`UserProfileDropdown`.
  Settings and navbar always show the same account/plan.
- **Deploy fix**: `/api/billing/status` `force-dynamic` (DYNAMIC_SERVER_USAGE).
- **Docs + workflow**: `/docs` system + consolidated `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Mobile**: Capacitor remote-URL wrapper; iOS build verified (`feat/capacitor-mobile`).

## Open issues
- `users` table missing → `save-onesignal` / `save-subscription` broken.
- `/api/stripe/cancel` missing → BillingSection cancel broken.
- Sentry env vars not set in Vercel (no prod error visibility).
- Dev uses prod Supabase (no staging); media bucket `memory-media` is public.
- Tech debt: duplicate export logic; two profile render paths; two search
  endpoints; schema not version-controlled; `npm audit` advisories.

## Active branch
`main` (production; auto-deploys). `feat/capacitor-mobile` holds mobile work
(pushed, unmerged).

## Next priorities
P0: fix `/api/stripe/cancel`; fix/remove broken OneSignal endpoints; confirm Sign
in with Apple. P1: set Sentry env in Vercel; native push;
Android build + store submission; workspace-switching UX.

## Blockers
None blocking web production. Mobile store submission blocked on Apple Developer /
Play Console accounts + native push + Android SDK.
