# RemyNest — Claude Workflow (authoritative)

The **single source of workflow truth**. `/docs` is the source of **content truth**.
Do not create parallel workflow/instruction files — enhance this one.

## Start every session (mandatory) — Session Continuity Rule

**Mandatory startup READ ORDER — do not skip, do not reorder:**
- **Step 0 — `docs/REMY_MASTER_STATE.md`** — the single authoritative source of truth (launch %,
  current/next task, VERIFIED COMPLETE, DO NOT REBUILD, LOCKED architecture decisions, launch
  blockers, open items). **Continue from its CURRENT TASK.**
- **Step 1 — this `CLAUDE.md`** — the authoritative workflow + architecture decisions (relevant sections).
- **Step 2 — `docs/handoffs/HANDOFF_CURRENT.md`** — the lightweight continuation log (never overrides the master state).
- **Step 3 — only task-relevant architecture/feature docs** (`docs/architecture/*`, `docs/features/*`; doc map below).
- **Step 4 — only task-relevant source code.**

**SOURCE CODE ALWAYS WINS** over any doc — if a doc disagrees with code, fix the doc in the same
task. No rediscovery, no rebuilding finished systems, no repeating completed audits. Do **not**
re-suggest anything under the master state's VERIFIED COMPLETE / DO NOT REBUILD / POST-LAUNCH
sections unless the operator explicitly asks. **After every completed task, run the mandatory
6-step maintenance protocol** (`docs/REMY_MASTER_STATE.md` → Maintenance Protocol: verify source →
update master state → update HANDOFF → update this file only if architecture changed → verify docs
match source → continue) — never ask, never skip.

Then, for every task:
1. Read **only the docs relevant to the task** (map below). Trust docs over rediscovery.
2. **Do not scan unrelated files** or run repository-wide analysis unless the task
   explicitly requires an audit. Identify the smallest set of files first.
3. **Do not repeat investigations already documented** (the master state / HANDOFF / this file),
   and **do not reintroduce retired features or re-litigate already-approved decisions**
   (e.g. the Workspace-navigation note below — the My Nest drawer row is retired).
4. **Treat documented architectural decisions as source-of-truth** — follow them
   unless concrete evidence in the current code proves a doc is stale; if so, fix the
   doc in the same task rather than silently diverging.

Doc map → product/system: `docs/MASTER_SPEC.md` · feature: `docs/features/<x>.md` ·
architecture: `docs/architecture/{system-architecture,database-overview,api-overview}.md` ·
audit entry: `docs/architecture/project-map.md` · priorities:
`docs/roadmap/launch-roadmap.md` · prompt templates: `docs/CLAUDE_WORKFLOW.md`.

## Operating modes

### INVESTIGATION MODE — default
Any prompt that does **not** contain the literal `EXECUTION MODE`. Read-only; no
code/migration/infra changes. Output **exactly** these four sections, then STOP and
wait for approval:
- **Documents Read**
- **Understanding**
- **Suspected Files**
- **Investigation Plan**

### EXECUTION MODE — on keyword
Triggered when the prompt contains `EXECUTION MODE`. Run the full cycle **without
waiting for approval**: investigate → implement → test → `npm run lint` →
`npm run build` → validate → update docs → commit → report (Completion Protocol).

## Token efficiency
- Documentation is authoritative; prefer it over rediscovery.
- Read the minimum necessary; targeted reads over broad greps.
- Never repository-wide scan when targeted inspection works.
- Schema is dashboard-managed — verify FK/RLS/columns in the Supabase SQL editor,
  not by scanning code.

## Engineering rules
- **Auth is protect-by-default (`middleware.ts`, authoritative 2026-06-17):** every
  route is PROTECTED unless explicitly in `PUBLIC_ROUTES` (and the `(app)` route
  group is also auth-gated in its layout). Make a *genuinely public* page public by
  adding it to `PUBLIC_ROUTES`; do **not** reintroduce a PROTECTED_ROUTES allowlist
  (it silently bounced logged-in users on any forgotten authenticated route — the
  B1 launch blocker). New authenticated routes need no registration.
- Respect this auth model; RLS scoping (the service-role client
  **bypasses RLS** — scope every admin query by user id); **return structured
  results, never `throw`, for expected business rules** (Server Action errors are
  redacted in production); non-clinical AI language.
- **Infra / launch-blocker audit CLOSED (authoritative 2026-06-17):** B1 auth
  (protect-by-default), B2 storage privacy (`memory-media` bucket is **private** —
  PHI served via signed URLs only), B3 caregiver-authz RLS (`20260608180000`
  applied), and B5 prod env (Stripe LIVE + Sentry) are **DONE**. **B4 PITR is
  intentionally deferred post-launch (cost)** — daily backups are the recovery
  baseline (accepted coarser-RPO risk; enable PITR at scale). **Do not re-flag
  B1–B3/B5 or PITR as open launch blockers** — they are resolved/decided. The
  remaining V1 gate is product/App-Store work (e.g. Apple 3.1.1 / IAP), not infra.
- No `eslint-disable` / TS suppression; never weaken auth or validation; no Stripe
  or schema changes without approval.
- **iOS purchase compliance (Apple 3.1.1, authoritative 2026-06-17):** never surface
  Stripe / web-checkout / customer-portal purchase UI on native — gate every purchase
  entry point with `lib/platform.ts` (`useIsNativePlatform()` render guard +
  `isNativePlatform()` handler short-circuit). New purchase/upgrade UI must be
  **web-only**; on native show a neutral Premium-feature state with **no** external
  link or "subscribe on the web" text (anti-steering 3.1.3). Cancellation (no
  redirect) may stay. Do not reintroduce an un-gated checkout/portal CTA.
- Destructive / outward-facing actions (DB migration, deletion, Vercel, deploy) are
  **operator steps** unless explicitly authorized — provide the exact command.
- **`main` auto-deploys to production.** Don't commit/push/merge unless asked
  (EXECUTION MODE authorizes the commit step for the task at hand).

### Critical systems — do not break
Authentication · Supabase (RLS) · Stripe billing · OneSignal · memory CRUD ·
media uploads · timeline · search · memory chat · AI insights (non-clinical) ·
profile/workspace switching · caregiver workflows · GDPR export/delete.

**Workspace navigation (authoritative, 2026-06-17):** **"My Nest"** (the personal
workspace) navigation lives in the **profile dropdown** — `ProfileHub` renders the
"My Nest" entry, which closes the menu, calls `setPersonalWorkspace` (cookie), and
navigates to `/home`. Selecting it **switches to the Personal Workspace and
navigates to `/home`** — My Nest is **not a page; it is a workspace state**.
**Care-profile switching + management** (enter a care workspace, invite caregiver,
add a person) lives in the **workspace drawer** (`WorkspaceSelector`, in the header)
and is **preserved on both desktop + mobile**. The drawer's old "My Nest" row was
**intentionally retired** — rationale: eliminates the drawer's recurring overlay/
scroll-lock trap, removes the duplicate My-Nest navigation path, preserves the
workspace architecture, and improves mobile UX. There is **no dedicated "My Nest"
page** (it is a workspace context; its home is `/home`).
Do **not** reintroduce a "My Nest" row in the workspace drawer, a "Switch to My
Nest" button in `ProfileMenuItems`, or a dedicated My Nest route.

**WorkspaceSelector drawer must be portaled (authoritative, 2026-06-18):** the
`WorkspaceSelector` open-drawer overlay (`fixed inset-0`) is rendered via
`createPortal(…, document.body)`. This is **required**, not cosmetic: the selector
is mounted inside the `backdrop-blur-md` app headers (`MobileTopBar`, `AppNavbar`),
and a non-`none` `backdrop-filter` establishes the **containing block** for
`position:fixed` descendants on WebKit/iOS — so an *inline* (non-portaled) overlay
re-roots to the header box and leaks the "Manage care profiles"/"Create profile"
fragments under the status bar on Home/My Nest (the long-standing TestFlight
corruption; prior header/safe-area fixes missed it). **Do not** un-portal that
overlay, and **do not** render any new `fixed`/full-screen modal inline under a
`backdrop-filter`/`transform`/`filter` ancestor — portal it to `document.body`.

**Native iOS reminder notifications are device-local (authoritative, 2026-06-20):**
reminders are scheduled **on-device** via `@capacitor/local-notifications`
(`lib/native-reminders.ts` reconcile engine + `<NativeReminderSync>` mounted on the
reminders page) so they fire **offline / without OneSignal / cron / APNs**.
`reconcileLocalReminders` is a **no-op off native iOS** — web/Android keep the server
cron path (hybrid; the cron is the fallback, not removed). The engine reads existing
reminder columns only (no schema change). **iOS plugin linking is CocoaPods, not SPM:**
main's Xcode project links Capacitor plugins via the `ios/App/Podfile` `capacitor_pods`
function (+ `App.xcworkspace`), so `CapacitorLocalNotifications` was added **there**;
Capacitor-8 `cap sync`'s `CapApp-SPM/Package.swift` is **inert on main** (0 SPM refs in
the project) and is removed. **Do not** migrate main to SPM / re-add `CapApp-SPM`,
regenerate the iOS project (`cap add ios`), or replace the Podfile/AppDelegate — those
carry the **OneSignal native init + bridge/ack pod (`OneSignalXCFramework 5.5.2`)** and
the APNs entitlements (OneSignal and local notifications **coexist**). **Foreground
banner (authoritative, 2026-06-21):** OneSignal swizzles `UNUserNotificationCenter`
and owns the foreground path, so local reminders were silent while the app was open.
`AppDelegate` now conforms to `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` and sets
`center.delegate = self` **before** `OneSignal.initialize`, returning
`[.banner,.list,.sound,.badge]` for local (interval/calendar) triggers and `[]` for
remote pushes (`UNPushNotificationTrigger`) — OneSignal/push behavior unchanged. **Do
not** remove that delegate or move the assignment after `OneSignal.initialize`.
Activation is an operator step: `cd ios/App && pod install` + a native build. See
`docs/features/local-notifications.md`.

**Reminder system is STABLE/VERIFIED — PROTECTED (authoritative, 2026-06-21):** the
end-to-end reminder system was **operator-validated on a physical iPhone (TestFlight
Build 8)** — notification delivery PASSES on **lock screen, background, AND foreground**;
plus My Nest + Care create/store/schedule/dashboard and the Add Reminder form reset
(after create + workspace switch). It is **production-ready with no active defects**.
Treat it as **frozen**: do **not** modify reminder creation/scheduling logic,
`NativeReminderSync`, local-notification code, `AppDelegate` notification code, OneSignal
integration, the reminder dashboard, reminder workspace isolation, reminder delivery, or
the form-reset implementation (`app/(app)/reminders/page.tsx` form `key`) — **unless a
future bug report explicitly proves a NEW defect**. Reminder work is now **bug-fix only**
and **must begin with an investigation proving the defect** before any code change.

**Reminder Sprint 1 — CONFIRMED-defect fixes applied (authoritative, 2026-07-07,
supersedes the "no active defects" clause above):** a Verification Sprint PROVED (from
code) four defects the Build-8 delivery validation did not cover, and — under the freeze's
own "unless a NEW defect is proven" carve-out — Sprint 1 fixed them: **(1)** completing a
**recurring** reminder no longer ends the series — it advances `remind_at` to the next
occurrence (shared `lib/reminders/recurrence.ts`; UI button "Done for today"); Delete still
ends a series. **(2)** the cron `processing` lock now has a **lease/reclaim** (`processing_at`
col, `PROCESSING_LEASE_MS`) so a crashed/timed-out tick can't strand a reminder. **(3)**
`toggle`/`delete` server actions now do an authoritative fetch + `userCanAccessProfile`
(parity with create/`[id]`), scoped by the reminder's OWN owner/profile, not the cookie.
**(4)** native iOS **duplicate** (local + cron push) is de-duped: the device reports pending
locals (`<NativeReminderBeacon>` → `/api/reminders/native-active` → `reminder_local_confirmations`)
and the cron skips the redundant push for a fresh, user_id-matched confirmation while still
doing bookkeeping — **fails toward delivery** (never a silent miss). **The frozen native
scheduler stayed UNTOUCHED** (`native-reminders.ts`/`NativeReminderSync`/`AppDelegate.swift`);
the beacon only READS `getPending()`. All schema changes are **probe-gated (inert until the
operator applies the migrations** `20260707120000` + `20260707130000`), so the deploy is a
no-op until activated. **Still frozen/out-of-scope + unfixed:** the cron recurring-reschedule
**DST/month-end drift** (a separate proven defect, NOT fixed), and true single-delivery
certainty (needs an iOS Notification Service Extension — operator/native). Do **not** re-flag
the four fixed items; a future reminder change still requires a proven defect first.

**Two authoritative standards (Production Sprint 2, 2026-07-07):** **(A) The Stripe webhook
MUST return non-2xx when a required DB write fails.** `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`
returns **HTTP 500** if any `profiles` write errors (so Stripe retries the whole event);
a `!data` "no matching row" stays **200** (not retryable — don't loop). Writes are idempotent
(`.eq(id|customer|subscription)`), so retries never duplicate state. Do **not** revert to
acknowledging (200) an event whose write failed — that silently desyncs premium/entitlements/
quota. **(B) Every write that accepts a workspace from the client-settable active-profile
cookie MUST app-layer-authorize it** with `userCanAccessProfile(user.id, activeProfileId)`
BEFORE the write — RLS alone is NOT sufficient (schema is dashboard-managed/unverifiable).
`createReminder`, `toggle/deleteReminder`, and now **`POST /api/memories/create`** all do this;
a null `activeProfileId` (My Nest) needs no check. **Known still-open (verify/fix later, per the
audit):** the `memories` INSERT **RLS** must be confirmed in the Supabase SQL editor; the memory
**edit** (`PUT /api/memories/[id]`) authorization was NOT part of this sprint — audit it before
relying on it. **Not production-ready** — the full audit (a11y, performance, security sweep,
PWA/offline, deep auth) was interrupted and is incomplete.

**Active development focus (authoritative, 2026-06-21): Memory Media Experience
Upgrade** — multi-media memories (reminders are done). **Phase 1: multiple photos per
memory** — reuse `memories.attachments` (jsonb array of `{url, name, mimeType}`) +
`cover_image_url`; **no schema redesign, backward compatible, no data-loss migration**.
Phases 2-4: gallery previews (Facebook-album grids) → detail carousel → full-screen
viewer. **Architect storage so future media (video/voice/audio/docs/PDF) add via the
`attachments` `mimeType` field without another attachment-system redesign.** Fold in the
memories/timeline **image-decode OOM** fix (serve thumbnails via
`lib/memory-media-signing.ts` + paginate). See `docs/roadmap/launch-roadmap.md`.

**Thumbnail Architecture (authoritative, 2026-06-22):** the image-decode OOM fix is
implemented as a **hybrid size ladder** served from the single stored original (the
`memory-media` bucket is **PRIVATE** + signed — never reintroduce a public bucket).
`lib/memory-media-signing.ts` mints **THUMB** (`400×400 cover q70`, feed/list) and
**MEDIUM** (`1080 contain q75`, detail + `PhotoViewer`) via the **SINGULAR**
`createSignedUrl(path, ttl, { transform })` (Supabase on-the-fly transforms, CDN-cached);
the **BATCH `createSignedUrls`** (untransformed) is always run first as the **hard
fallback** — do **not** drop it. `signMemories`/`signMemory` take `{ variant,
maxImagesPerMemory }`; **variant is optional — default (no variant) is byte-identical to
the untransformed baseline**, so leave search/create/reminiscence callers as-is. Each
image carries `fallbackUrl` (untransformed) for client recovery (`MediaThumb` 2-stage,
`PhotoViewer` per-slide, `CompactMemoryRow`). **Operator gate (authoritative):**
transforms require Supabase Image Transformations (**Pro plan**) **and** env
**`MEMORY_IMAGE_TRANSFORMS_ENABLED=true`**; **default OFF** is the no-regression
guarantee — the feature is inert until the operator enables both. `/api/memories` +
`/api/timeline` are **paginated** (`limit`/`offset` `.range`, default 50) to bound the
singular-signing fan-out; the memories feed client **aggregates pages into a flat array**
(do not convert the feed query to infinite-scroll — it would break the optimistic
create/edit/delete mutations). Do **not** re-flag thumbnails/pagination as a TODO. See
`docs/features/media-system.md`. Future-media previews (video poster, PDF first-page)
reuse the existing `attachment.thumbnailUrl` field — a stored-derivative branch, not yet
built.

**Media upload = DIRECT-TO-STORAGE, API is metadata-only (authoritative, 2026-06-24):**
media uploads **client → Supabase Storage directly** via signed URLs; `/api/memories/create`
+ PUT `/api/memories/[id]` receive **JSON attachment metadata, NEVER raw file bytes** — this
bypasses the ~4.5 MB Vercel function-body limit (large videos work). Flow: `POST
/api/memories/upload-url` (`lib/memory-direct-upload.ts` `uploadAttachmentsDirect`) →
`uploadToSignedUrl`. **Security invariants — do NOT weaken:** (1) storage paths are
**server-generated + owner-scoped** (`users/{userId}/...`) — the client never chooses a path;
(2) **quota is server-authoritative** — pre-checked at sign time AND **re-verified against the
REAL object size** (`getStorageObjectInfo`, `lib/storage/object-info.ts`) at create/edit, never
the client-reported size; (3) **every attachment path is owner-scoped** (`isOwnedStoragePath`)
on create AND edit **including the kept set** (a PUT that planted a foreign `users/{victim}/`
path let the RLS-bypassing service-role signer mint a signed URL for the victim's private
object — a final guard over the whole attachment set blocks it). The legacy multipart branch in
both routes is **dormant fallback (rollback only)** — do not route clients back to it. Care
isolation is unchanged (`memory_profile_id` from the server cookie context, not the client).
**Known follow-up (not a blocker):** orphan objects (uploaded, never attached) aren't
ledger-counted + there's no sweeper yet — add an orphan-sweep cron + a bucket object-size
limit. See `docs/features/media-system.md`.

**Memory create = insert-first, AI enrichment is DEFERRED (authoritative, 2026-06-24):**
`POST /api/memories/create` **uploads → inserts the row → returns immediately**; it does
**NOT** run AI synchronously. Awaiting `generateMemoryInsights`/`generateEmbedding` (and
`buildRelationships/clusters/people`) BEFORE the insert — with no `maxDuration` — was the
primary cause of Vercel function-timeout failures that **lost the memory entirely** (~95%
on device, Build 9 testing). The enrichment pipeline now lives in **`lib/memory-enrichment.ts`**
(`enrichMemory` — idempotent, fault-isolated, UPDATE-based) behind **`POST /api/memories/[id]/enrich`**
(`maxDuration=60`, owner-scoped), triggered **fire-and-forget by the client** after a
successful save. **Do NOT reintroduce synchronous AI/embedding/cognition on the create
request.** The enrichment LOGIC (people/relationship/cluster systems) is unchanged — only
relocated. **Known remaining limit:** media bytes still proxy through the function, so the
**~4.5 MB Vercel request-body limit** still 413s large videos/batches — the fix is
**direct-to-storage upload (client→Supabase, API metadata-only)**, PLANNED not built.
**Responsive nav breakpoint = `lg` (authoritative, 2026-06-24):** the mobile↔desktop nav
swap is gated at **`lg` (1024px)**, NOT `md` (768px) — landscape iPhones (~844–932px) must
keep the touch nav. `AppNavbar` `hidden lg:flex`; `MobileTopBar`/`MobileBottomNav`/
`MobileNavDrawer` `lg:hidden`; `WorkspaceSelector` drawer `max-lg:`/`lg:`; `<main>` `pb-24
lg:pb-6`. Do not revert these to `md`.

**Project Polaris — UX refactor, Pass 1 shipped (authoritative, 2026-07-08):** an app-wide
"calmer, simpler, Apple-quality, lower-cognitive-load" redesign; **presentation ONLY** — no
backend/auth/schema/API/business-logic changes, every feature preserved. Cadence:
**flagship-first, then page-by-page** (each page audited → implemented → validated). **Pass 1
(done): Dashboard + shell.** **(1) The bottom-nav center action is now Remy, not "+".** The
green "+" FAB was retired: the center slot renders the **Remy avatar** (`<Remy state="welcome">`
via the asset registry) and tapping it opens a **calm, portaled bottom action-sheet**
(`components/navigation/RemyActionButton.tsx` — **SUPERSEDED 2026-07-09:** the center is now the
behaviour-driven **Nest** [`components/navigation/nest/*`]; `RemyActionButton` was deleted — see the
authoritative "The Nest — Remy's living HOME, behaviour-driven" note below) with **existing routes only** — Ask Remy
(`/remy`), Add a memory (`/memories/new`), Add a reminder (`/reminders`). **No deferred
AI/conversation was built** — it only routes to surfaces that already exist. The sheet is
`createPortal(document.body)` (**required** — the host `MobileBottomNav` has `backdrop-blur`,
so a non-portaled `fixed` overlay would re-root on WebKit/iOS; same invariant as the
`WorkspaceSelector` drawer), focus-trapped (shared `useFocusTrap`), scroll-locked,
Escape-to-close, and threads the `context` query-param (care routing unchanged).
`FloatingCompanionButton` gained `variant "solid"|"nest"` (default `solid` = the old look,
unchanged) so the purple Companion/Remy avatar reads on a clean **nest** pedestal (never
purple-on-sage). **Do NOT reintroduce the "+" center FAB** or route the center button straight
to `/memories/new`. **(2) Dashboard IA** (`app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`): the ~20 stacked
widgets are regrouped into a calm progression — Greeting → Attention alerts → **Today** →
**Jump back in** → **People** → **Insights** (a summary tile → `/insights`) → **Account &
storage** — with the heavy Remy analytics + account cards collapsed into a zero-JS,
keyboard-accessible native-`<details>` `CollapsibleSection` (**children stay MOUNTED when
collapsed**, so telemetry effects still run). The **async data body is byte-unchanged**; only
the `return` JSX changed and **every widget is preserved** (nothing removed — only relocated).
**Do NOT re-stack all dashboard widgets** into one flat scroll or re-flag the analytics
overload as an open issue. **Deferred to later Polaris passes:** the reminders page is
**presentation-only when reached** (its FROZEN scheduling/sync/delivery/form-reset stay
untouched); Search, Timeline, Library, and Settings remain to be redesigned.

**Project Polaris — Pass 2 shipped (authoritative, 2026-07-08): Home + Memories.**
Presentation-only (no data/logic/query/mutation change). **Memories**
(`app/(app)/memories/page.tsx`, presentation region only — the React-Query feed
[paginated→flat aggregation], optimistic create/edit/delete, `handleSearch` debounce, and
sort/grouping are byte-unchanged): the off-brand chrome was retired — the `bg-black` search
button, the `bg-yellow-50` workspace banner, and the `text-gray` "Loading…/Updating…/Searching…"
text are **gone**. The page now has a serif header + a single **brand search field** (leading
magnifier, sage focus ring, a **clear ×** button; live-debounced + Enter search preserved;
**`text-base`/16px so focusing it never triggers iOS zoom** — do not drop it below 16px), calm
reduced-motion-safe **skeleton** loading (`FeedSkeleton`), an `aria-live` status region, and an
explicit `htmlFor` label. `components/memories/MemorySection.tsx` (sticky section headers) and
`components/MemoryCard.tsx` were rebranded to brand tokens (no raw gray/stone), with a cleaner
memory-date row (icon + `sr-only` "Memory date:") and a sage focus ring; **sticky offsets
unchanged**. **Home** (`app/(app)/home/page.tsx`): serif h1, ≥44px touch targets + sage focus
rings on all CTAs, calmer `max-w-2xl` column, new `app/(app)/home/loading.tsx` skeleton.
Verified: tsc/lint/build green + independent adversarial review (BEHAVIOR PRESERVED: yes; its
two findings — iOS focus-zoom + a screen-reader date label — were fixed). **Do NOT** reintroduce
the black search button / yellow banner / gray text loaders, drop the search input below 16px,
or change the memories feed's data/query/mutation layer.

**Project Polaris — Pass 3 shipped (authoritative, 2026-07-08): People + Insights.**
Presentation-only (no data/query/logic change). **People** (`app/(app)/profiles/page.tsx`,
return JSX only): serif header, calm `max-w-2xl` column, `rounded-3xl` list with subtle
`divide-y` separators, polished empty state; `PersonRow` gained a sage focus ring + roomier
`px-3 py-3` (still ≥44px); **`AddPersonButton`** got a bigger touch target + focus ring and its
modal now **traps focus + Escape-closes + restores focus + locks scroll** (shared `useFocusTrap`;
`role="dialog"` on the panel; `bg-charcoal/40` scrim) — the `CreateProfileForm` flow is
unchanged; new `app/(app)/profiles/loading.tsx` skeleton. **Insights**
(`components/insights/InsightsClient.tsx` + `app/(app)/insights/page.tsx` + `loading.tsx`) —
goal was **calm, not analytical**: the page now opens with the narrative layer VISIBLE (serif
header [was `text-5xl`/`#243428`/`text-gray`], `AIDisclaimer`, `RemyInsightsCenter` companion
summary, `AIInsightSummary`) and the **11 detailed charts collapsed into a native-`<details>`
"Detailed analytics"** progressive disclosure. **Nothing removed** — every chart + all
`useMemo`/cognition-engine/analytics computation is byte-unchanged (verified: compute region 0
diff hunks); charts still mount and render when expanded (recharts `ResponsiveContainer`
re-measures on open). The off-brand `ChartSkeleton` + route skeleton + the `bg-[#f5f1e8]` page
bg were rebranded to tokens; container narrowed `max-w-7xl`→`max-w-4xl`. Verified: tsc/lint/build
green + independent adversarial review (BEHAVIOR PRESERVED: yes). **Do NOT** re-expand all
Insights charts into one flat scroll, restore the `text-5xl`/raw-hex header, or re-flag the
Insights analytics-overload as an open issue. **Polaris roadmap remaining:** Timeline,
Library, Settings, reminders-presentation.

**Project Polaris — Pass 4 shipped (authoritative, 2026-07-08): Search.** Presentation-only
(no search logic/query/embeddings/ranking/filter/pagination/debounce/keyboard change).
**`app/(app)/search/page.tsx`**: the `sr-only` h1 became a **visible serif title + inviting
subtitle**; `RemySearchInsights` + `SearchView` unchanged. **`components/search/SearchView.tsx`**
(presentation only): the field is now an inviting **rounded-full pill** with a leading icon +
sage `focus-within` ring (`text-base`/no-iOS-zoom, clear button, 250 ms debounce,
`AbortController` cancel, `Remy.emit`, `/api/search/global` fetch, localStorage recents — all
byte-unchanged); filter/recent/suggestion chips got sage focus rings + roomier `px-4 py-2`; a
**calm discovery hero** (`RemyStage context="welcome"` + a plain-language invitation) leads the
empty state; group-collapse buttons got focus rings + a reduced-motion chevron.
**`components/search/SearchResultRow.tsx`**: the off-palette amber/sky/violet/rose type tints
were neutralized to a single brand **sage** (type still shown by icon + badge text — hierarchy
over colour) + a sage focus ring. **`app/(app)/search/loading.tsx`** rewritten to mirror the new
layout (brand tokens, reduced-motion-safe). Verified: tsc/lint/build green + independent
adversarial review (SEARCH LOGIC UNCHANGED: yes). **Do NOT** reintroduce the rainbow result
tints, revert the field below `text-base`, or alter the search debounce/abort/fetch/ranking.
**Polaris roadmap remaining:** Library, Settings, reminders-presentation.

**Project Polaris — Pass 5 shipped (authoritative, 2026-07-08): Timeline.** Presentation-only
(no timeline logic/query/sorting/date-grouping/chronology/pagination/`signMemories`/AI-enrichment/
navigation/routing change). Timeline was built pre-brand-system, so this was the **largest rebrand
yet — 13 files** taken from raw `gray/black/yellow/#f5f1e8` + oversized `text-4xl/5xl` titles →
the Polaris system. **`app/(app)/timeline/page.tsx`** (server; the auth/`getActiveContext`/
pagination [PAGE_SIZE/SAFETY_CAP/isNarrowed/shown/fetchLimit]/memories query/filtering/
`signMemories`/`groupMemoriesByDate`/categories query are **byte-unchanged** — presentation region
only): `max-w-3xl` reading column; the `bg-yellow-50` no-profile notice, `bg-[#f5f1e8]` sticky bar,
`border-gray-100`/`shadow-sm` empty state, and `text-gray-800` auth fallback rebranded; the empty
state is now a calm serif **"Your story starts here"** + CTA. **`TimelineHeader`** → serif +
warmer copy ("AI Timeline" → "Timeline"). **`TimelineDayGroup`** sticky date headers → `bg-sand` +
`charcoal-muted` (sticky `12.5rem`/`3.5rem` offsets **unchanged** — mobile control-bar heights were
preserved, so do not alter them without re-checking the day-header offset). **`TimelineCard`**
(desktop `<details>`): rebrand, serif title (`text-4xl`→`text-2xl md:text-3xl`), `🕰 Memory Date:`
→ `CalendarClock` + `sr-only`, summary focus ring, reduced-motion; native expand untouched.
**Control bar** (`TimelineViewToggle`/`TimelineCategories`/`TimelineSearch`): `bg-black` active →
`bg-sage`, `text-base` search input, sage focus rings, `aria-current`; every href/URL-builder +
the `GET`-form search preserved. **Chapters view** (`ChaptersView`/`LifeChapterCard`/
`RelatedMemories`) + `TimelineRow`/`TimelineAttachmentImage` rebranded; hrefs/dedup preserved.
`loading.tsx` rewritten (brand, reduced-motion-safe). (`IntelligenceStrip` + `CompactChapterRow`
were already clean.) Verified: brand sweep CLEAN · tsc/lint/build green · adversarial review
(TIMELINE LOGIC UNCHANGED: yes). **Known pre-existing (NOT introduced):** the in-bar Search/Clear/
toggle/chip touch targets are `<44px` — left as-is because enlarging them grows the mobile
control-bar height and would break the calibrated day-header sticky offset. **Do NOT** reintroduce
raw gray/black/#f5f1e8 on Timeline or restore the `text-4xl/5xl` titles. **Polaris roadmap
remaining:** Library, Settings, reminders-presentation.

**Project Polaris — Pass 6 shipped (authoritative, 2026-07-08): Library.** Presentation-only
(no queries/filtering/routing/hrefs/data-loading/auth/state change). The Library was already
~90% brand-aligned, so this was a light refinement (**6 files**; the shared `Remy*` renderers —
`RemyStoryMode`/`RemyBiography`/`RemyMemoryBook` — were treated as **black boxes** and left
untouched). **`components/library/LibraryView.tsx`** is a **pure client-side filter over a
static 6-destination `SECTIONS` list** (no data logic): the one off-brand `bg-stone-50` →
`bg-sand`; the search input `text-sm`→**`text-base`** (no iOS zoom) as a rounded-full pill with
a sage `focus-within` ring; filter chips + sage focus rings + ring-clearance; the destination
list → `rounded-3xl`/`shadow-soft` with a sage focus ring per row `<Link>`; the bare empty-state
`<p>` → a calm card — `SECTIONS`/`CHIPS`/hrefs/`useState`/filter predicate **byte-identical**.
**`app/(app)/library/page.tsx`** → semantic `<header>` + **serif h1** + `max-w-2xl` column +
warmer "personal archive" subtitle. **`story`/`biography`/`memory-book` `page.tsx`** (server;
auth + `Promise.all(getRemy…)` + `derive*Signals` + the `Remy*` renderer calls **byte-unchanged**):
back-link focus ring + an additive **`sr-only` `<h1>`** (each renderer tops out at `<h2>`, so this
gives one valid document `<h1>` without duplication) + a calm empty card. New
**`app/(app)/library/loading.tsx`** brand skeleton (reduced-motion-safe). Verified: brand sweep
CLEAN · tsc/lint/build green · adversarial review (LIBRARY LOGIC UNCHANGED: yes). **Do NOT**
rebrand the shared `Remy*` renderers under Library or drop the hub search below `text-base`.
**Polaris roadmap remaining:** Settings, reminders-presentation.

**Project Polaris — Pass 7 shipped (authoritative, 2026-07-08): Settings.** Presentation-only
(no profile-update/GDPR-export/account-delete/reauth/auth/routing/state change; adversarially
verified — every flow UNCHANGED). Scope-locked to **7 files**; **`StorageUsageCard`,
`ProfileHeader`, `ProfileSection` are BLACK BOXES** (shared / purchase-adjacent — untouched).
**`app/(app)/settings/page.tsx`**: fixed a **nested `<main>`** (→`<div>`; the `(app)` layout
already renders the outer `<main>`), added semantic `<header>` + **serif h1** + subtitle, storage
wrapper `rounded-3xl`; `resolveAccountIdentity`/`redirect`/composition unchanged.
**`AccountInformationSection`** (frozen `handleSave`/`PATCH /api/profile`), **`ExportDataSection`**
(frozen `handleExport`/`GET /api/gdpr/export`/blob), **`PrivacyLinksSection`** (frozen hrefs),
**`DeleteAccountSection`** (frozen modal trigger): `neutral/gray`→`charcoal`, `rounded-2xl` cards,
**`text-base` inputs + sage focus rings**, `bg-black` buttons → sage (≥44px), `green`→`sage-deep`.
**Destructive UI uses the brand `rose` palette** (approved — the app's delete convention: danger
zone + delete buttons). **`DeleteAccountModal`** (CRITICAL — presentation-only): `bg-black/50`
scrim → `bg-charcoal/40`, `red`→`rose`, `neutral/gray`→`charcoal`, `rounded-3xl`, **`text-base`
password/typed inputs + sage focus rings**, ≥44px Cancel/Delete, and additive **`role="dialog"` +
`aria-label`** on the panel (**deliberately NO `aria-modal`** — since a focus-trap could not be
added under the freeze, we do not assert unenforced modality; **NO focus-trap/Escape/keyboard
handler added** — keyboard behaviour byte-identical). **Every** `useState`/`useEffect`/`canSubmit`/
`reauthOAuth`/`handleDelete`/`GET`+`DELETE /api/gdpr/delete-account`/`signOut`/`window.location`/
typed-confirmation/`password`/`deleteContributed` binding is **byte-identical** (verified
line-by-line). New **`app/(app)/settings/loading.tsx`** brand skeleton (reduced-motion-safe).
Verified: brand sweep CLEAN · tsc/lint/build green · adversarial review (SETTINGS/PROFILE/EXPORT/
DELETE/REAUTH/AUTH/ROUTING all UNCHANGED). **Do NOT** revert the delete/reauth logic, add a
focus-trap without lifting the freeze, or touch the `StorageUsageCard`/`ProfileHeader`/
`ProfileSection` black boxes here. **Polaris roadmap remaining:** Reminders (presentation only).

**Project Polaris — Pass 8 shipped (authoritative, 2026-07-08): Reminders — FINAL PASS.**
Presentation-only refinement of the **CRITICAL FROZEN** reminder surface (adversarially verified
— all 16 flows UNCHANGED: reminder logic/creation/editing/deletion/completion/delivery/OneSignal/
NativeReminderSync/AppDelegate/timezone/background-tasks/API/Supabase-mutations/auth/routing/
**form-reset `key`**). The reminder system remains **SECURITY/PRODUCTION FROZEN** — only visual
presentation changed. Already brand-aligned, so a light **4-file** refinement. **Black boxes
(untouched):** `NativeReminderSync`, `NativeReminderBeacon`, `ReminderDateTimeField` (timezone
logic — only its parent-passed className got `text-base`), `lib/native-reminders.ts`,
`lib/reminders/*`, `app/api/reminders/*`. **`app/(app)/reminders/page.tsx`** (return only; the
`createReminder`/`toggle`/`delete` server actions, the **form `key`**, the `NativeReminderSync`/
`NativeReminderBeacon` mounts, and every input `name` are **byte-identical**): `max-w-3xl`, **serif
h1** (`text-4xl`→`text-2xl md:text-3xl`), summary focus ring + reduced-motion chevron, **`text-base`
inputs** (title/date/frequency — no iOS zoom), submit focus ring. **`ReminderCenter.tsx`** (frozen
`useMemo`/`useState`/toggle+delete forms + hidden `id`/`completed`): raw hex `text-[#9c7e3f]` →
`text-gold-ink`, hero `rounded-3xl` + serif "Next up" title, card + button reduced-motion +
additive sage/rose focus rings (`rose`/`gold` = approved urgency/destructive). **`reminders/[id]/
page.tsx`**: existing debug view restyled (container + serif h1 + brand `<pre>`; no new nav;
auth/fetch frozen). New **`app/(app)/reminders/loading.tsx`** skeleton. **Do NOT** modify reminder
scheduling/delivery/native/OneSignal/AppDelegate/mutation/form-reset logic (freeze reaffirmed).

**PROJECT POLARIS COMPLETE (authoritative, 2026-07-08):** the app-wide **presentation-only** UX
redesign is FINISHED across all 8 passes — **(1)** Dashboard + shell (Remy FAB) · **(2)** Home +
Memories · **(3)** People + Insights · **(4)** Search · **(5)** Timeline · **(6)** Library ·
**(7)** Settings · **(8)** Reminders. Every pass was presentation-only over frozen logic,
brand-swept clean, tsc/lint/build green, and independently adversarially verified (behaviour
byte-preserved). The whole app now shares the Polaris design language (serif titles, sage/sand/
charcoal + gold/rose accents, `max-w` reading columns, `rounded-2xl/3xl` + `shadow-soft`, sage
focus rings, `text-base` inputs, ≥44px controls, reduced-motion-safe skeletons, progressive
disclosure). **No Polaris passes remain** — future UI work is FEATURE work, not this redesign.

**Caregiver revoke — owner-only access removal (authoritative, 2026-07-08):** the audit-identified
access-control gap (an owner could invite/accept caregivers but never REMOVE their access to a care
profile's PHI) is CLOSED. **`revokeCaregiver({memoryProfileId, caregiverAccountId})`** +
**`listProfileCaregivers(memoryProfileId)`** (`app/(app)/dashboard/actions.ts`) are **OWNER-ONLY**
(`userOwnsProfile`, session-derived user id — never trust a client-supplied id), return
**structured results (never throw)**, and use the **service-role client scoped to the owned
profile**. Revoke DELETEs the accepted `profile_relationships` row (scoped `memory_profile_id +
caregiver_account_id`, `.neq('relationship_type','owner')`), which immediately withdraws access —
`getAccessibleProfiles`/`userCanAccessProfile` require an ACCEPTED row and `getActiveContext`
re-validates the active-workspace cookie on read (a revoked caregiver falls back to My Nest on
their next request). Guards: **self-revoke blocked** (`caregiverId === user.id`), **owner row never
deletable**, **non-owner blocked before any write** (no IDOR — the scoped delete can only affect the
OWNED profile's row). **Deliberately NOT entitlement-gated** — revocation must work post-downgrade
(the owner's manual remedy for the FAMILY→FREE "downgrade doesn't auto-revoke" gap). UI:
**`components/CaregiverManager.tsx`** (caregiver list + Remove with inline confirm +
loading/success/error, Polaris design) in the `WorkspaceSelector` "Manage care profiles" panel;
renders nothing for non-owners. Invite/accept/decline/createProfile/workspace-switching are
byte-unchanged (additive only). **Still open (separate audit items, NOT done here):** the Stripe
downgrade path does not auto-revoke caregivers (manual revoke now exists); `access_level` is
stored/displayed but not enforced (any accepted relationship grants full write). Do NOT remove the
owner-only/self-revoke guards or entitlement-gate revocation.

**Subscription downgrade entitlement reconciliation (authoritative, 2026-07-08):** the
audit-identified gap (a FAMILY→PREMIUM/FREE downgrade or cancellation left accepted caregivers
with access) is CLOSED — complementing the manual owner-only revoke above.
**`reconcileEntitlementsForUser(userId, plan)`** (`lib/billing/reconcile-entitlements.ts`,
service-role, **structured result, never throws, idempotent**) runs from the Stripe **webhook**
downgrade paths (`customer.subscription.deleted` → FREE; `customer.subscription.updated` →
`!isActive ? "FREE" : derivedPlan ?? null` — null = unknown price = skip) AFTER the existing
profile write. When the NEW plan lacks caregiver collaboration (`getUsageLimits(plan).
caregiverCollaborationEnabled` — the single source of truth `BILLING_PLANS[plan].
caregiverCollaboration`; only FAMILY/ENTERPRISE grant it), it bulk-DELETEs accepted, non-owner
`profile_relationships` rows on the profiles the user OWNS (`created_by_account_id`), preserving
the owner's own row. **Non-destructive** (only access grants — never a care profile/memory/
reminder), **no escalation** (only deletes access; never grants/upgrades/writes plan/is_premium),
**no IDOR** (`userId` derived from the webhook's own write result `data.id`, never request input;
scoped to owned profiles). A reconciliation error sets the existing `writeFailed` flag → the
webhook's existing HTTP-500 retry (safe: idempotent). **All OTHER premium capabilities** (semantic
search, storage quota, care-profile creation limit, voice memories) are read-time-derived from the
persisted plan (`resolveSubscription`/`getUsageLimits`) → auto-reconciled by the plan write;
**existing over-limit care profiles are intentionally NOT deleted** (the repo enforces the limit at
CREATION time only — deleting existing profiles/memories would be destructive data loss, not a repo
rule). The webhook's existing writes / `writeFailed` semantics / 200-500 responses / checkout /
portal / payment-failed grace are **byte-unchanged (additive only)**. Do NOT make reconciliation
grant access, write plan/is_premium, gate it behind anything other than the entitlement check, or
delete care profiles/memories. (The former "`access_level` not enforced" gap is now CLOSED — see
the next note.)

**Caregiver `access_level` enforcement (authoritative, 2026-07-08 — closes the final V1 caregiver
access-control gap):** an accepted caregiver's write permission is now determined ONLY by their
`access_level` (`read` | `full` | `admin`, from the invite UI; default `full`) — previously EVERY
accepted caregiver had full write. **The authorization model:** Owner → full write always; accepted
caregiver → write ONLY per `access_level`; read-only caregivers keep ENTER + READ. **Single source
of truth in `lib/profile-ownership.ts`** (no duplicated authz logic): a private
**`resolveProfileRole(userId, profileId)`** is the ONE query path (owner via
`created_by_account_id`, else an ACCEPTED `profile_relationships` row + its `access_level`, else
none); **`accessLevelCanWrite(level)`** is the ONE permission rule — **only `read` restricts**
(`level !== "read"`), so `full`/`admin`/**null/legacy** rows stay write-capable (**no-regression** —
the invite default has always been `full`). Both **`userCanAccessProfile`** (access/enter/read —
external behavior BYTE-IDENTICAL to before: owner OR accepted → true) and the new
**`userCanWriteProfile`** (owner OR caregiver-with-write-level) derive from `resolveProfileRole`.
**Enforcement = 5 WRITE sites swapped `userCanAccessProfile` → `userCanWriteProfile`** (authorization
call only): `createReminder` + reminder toggle/complete + reminder delete
(`app/(app)/reminders/page.tsx`), `POST /api/create-reminder`, and `POST /api/memories/create`.
**READ/ENTER paths keep `userCanAccessProfile` UNCHANGED** (`getActiveContext` in
`lib/active-profile.ts`, the `reminders/[id]` view, `getAccessibleProfiles`) so a read-only
caregiver can still enter + view a care workspace. **Memory edit/delete** (`PUT`/`DELETE
/api/memories/[id]`) is `user_id`-scoped (owner-of-content) — NOT access-level-gated, unchanged.
**Caregiver management** (invite/list/revoke, `dashboard/actions.ts`) stays `userOwnsProfile`
owner-only. **The FROZEN reminder scheduling/delivery/native-sync/OneSignal/recurrence/form-reset
logic is byte-unchanged** — this was an authorization-only swap (operator-approved under the freeze's
authorization-hardening carve-out; adversarially verified: reminder behavior byte-preserved). `userId`
is session-derived at every site; `access_level` is read server-side (service-role) — never client
input (no IDOR/escalation). Validation: tsc clean · lint 0 errors · build ✓ · independent adversarial
review CLEAN (all 12 verdicts YES). Do NOT gate READ/enter on `userCanWriteProfile`, add a second
authz query path, or change the `accessLevelCanWrite` rule without updating this single source.

**Storage Ledger Foundation (authoritative, 2026-06-23):** per-attachment storage
**accounting** (bytes) is implemented as a `storage_ledger` table maintained
**incrementally by a trigger on `memories`** (`sync_storage_ledger()`, fires
`AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OF attachments, memory_profile_id, user_id`) that projects the
`attachments` jsonb — **chosen over dynamic compute** for O(1) reads, and a trigger
(not app dual-write) **because the upload pipeline is frozen**. The trigger is
**null/non-array/malformed-safe and must stay that way — it can NEVER raise**, or it
would abort memory writes (a critical system). `reconcile_storage_ledger()` does
idempotent backfill + drift repair; `storage_account_usage` (`security_invoker`) is the
read path. In RemyNest **`workspace_id == memory_profile_id`** (NULL = My Nest), so no
separate `profile_id` column. **`lib/storage/`** holds plan limits as **config only**
(FREE/STARTER/PREMIUM/FAMILY — **no pricing/checkout/billing**; decoupled from the frozen
`lib/billing` via the `resolveStorageTier()` seam, default FREE), `getStorageUsage`
(service-role, **always scoped by the member id set** — family-pool-ready by summing
across members, **no schema redesign needed**), and `checkStorageQuota` (structured
result, never throws, byte-based → future-media-proof). **Upload enforcement IS wired
(authoritative, 2026-06-23):** `enforceUploadQuota` (`lib/storage/upload-guard.ts`)
sums the **total batch** bytes, resolves pool members (`resolveStoragePoolMembers` →
`[userId]` today, the family seam) and calls `checkStorageQuota`, then gates
**`POST /api/memories/create`** and **`PUT /api/memories/[id]`** **before**
`buildMemoryMediaPayload` (the storage-write choke point) — over-quota → **HTTP 413
`{ error, quota }`**. A **0-byte batch always passes** (text-only memory / remove-only
edit never blocked); **fails closed** on a degraded usage read; the edit path counts
only the **new** files. Do **not** duplicate this accounting or add a second
enforcement path — reuse `enforceUploadQuota`. **Migration is an operator step** (apply
`20260623120000_storage_ledger_foundation.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor). Do **not**
re-derive the ledger decisions or redesign the schema. See
`docs/features/storage-ledger.md`.

**Brand system (authoritative, 2026-06-23):** RemyNest has **two coexisting brand
systems sharing GOLD as the bridge** — **(A) Product/Brand = sage `#4F6B5B` / sand
`#F5F1EA` / gold `#C9A86A`** (logo, app icon, favicon, OG, all UI chrome — "NOT
healthcare blue") and **(B) Companion/Remy = purple `#8A6BD0`→`#5B3E8E` + pendant
`#E3A24A`** (the **in-app avatar/chat ONLY**). The product logo is the geometric
**nest** mark (`public/brand/logo-*.svg`); a simplified sage/gold **brand Remy**
(`remy-mark.svg`) is the secondary mark. **Do NOT** recolor the validated in-app Remy
sprite (`components/remy/avatar/*`, `public/remy/remy-blueprint.png`) to sage, and
**do NOT** put purple Remy on the product brand. Type = **Fraunces** (display/h1–h4)
+ **Inter** (body/UI); body floor **17px**. **A11y (authoritative):** **gold
`#C9A86A` FAILS as text (1.9:1)** — accent/large-graphic only; use **gold-ink
`#7A5E22`** for links/accent-text; gold buttons take **charcoal** ink; focus rings are
**sage**, never gold. Tokens: `lib/brand/tokens.ts` + `tailwind.config.js` +
`app/globals.css` (`:root` + `.dark`). **Dark theme is mechanism-only** (`darkMode:
'class'` + `.dark` vars) — do **not** flip dark UI on broadly until components are
audited. Icons/OG auto-wire via `app/{icon.svg,apple-icon.tsx,opengraph-image.tsx}`.
See `docs/brand/brand-guidelines.md`. **Pending (staged):** raster exports
(store/Play/social/true-square PWA), the 17px/scale migration across ~544 small-text
sites, dark-UI rollout.

**Launch priority (authoritative, 2026-06-23 — supersedes prior "active development

checklist.
**Remy companion — FOUNDATION APPROVED + IMPLEMENTED (authoritative, 2026-06-28):** the
operator re-prioritized **Phase 1 of the Remy companion as plug-in ARCHITECTURE ONLY** — no
artwork, no animations, no AI, no conversation. Built: **`lib/remy/companion/*`** (state-
machine types, asset **registry**, animation-controller **INTERFACE** + placeholder impl,
AI-hook **types**) + **`components/remy/companion/*`** (`RemyProvider` = split state/actions
contexts; `FloatingCompanionLayer` = portaled, safe-area-aware overlay = Remy's home;
`FloatingCompanionButton` = the dual-mode abstraction the bottom-nav "+" now uses and the
Nest later takes over by swapping `href` → `onActivate={toggleRemy}`), mounted in
`(app)/layout.tsx`. Assets are referenced by KEY (swap art in the registry — no code change);
the animation backend is chosen behind one seam (`createRemyAnimationController` — Rive/Lottie/
CSS/Framer plug in with zero consumer change). Performance: `children` is a stable prop +
split contexts, so opening/closing Remy re-renders ONLY the provider + the layer. **Do NOT
re-defer, re-scaffold, or re-litigate this foundation.**

**Remy asset pipeline — SINGLE FLAT FOLDER (authoritative, 2026-07-01 — supersedes the
2026-06-28 master/production/archive structure):** every Remy/Nest asset lives **directly in
`public/assets/remy/`** — there is **no** `master/`, `production/`, or `archive/` sub-folder
(the operator retired that structure as over-complicated; those folders were removed and must
**not** be reintroduced). The approved canonical character is **Remy Master v1.0** at
**`public/assets/remy/remy_master_v1.png`** — an **immutable brand reference**: read-only,
never modified/overwritten, **not** registered as an app asset (never wired into the app). The
character must **never** be redesigned/reinterpreted; every export must match it exactly
(proportions, scarf, golden-feather heart pendant, palette) — this is the purple+gold
**Companion/Remy** identity, NOT the product/brand sage mark, and is distinct from the separate
frozen in-app sprite at `components/remy/avatar/*` + `public/remy/`. The app reads Remy/Nest art
**only** through the Asset Registry (`lib/remy/companion/asset-registry.ts`), the **SOLE owner
of asset paths** (`BASE = "/assets/remy"`; components reference assets by KEY, never by path).
**Current status:** the registry has **23 app assets, ALL real approved artwork** (`kind:
"image"`, 0 placeholders). To add/replace art: drop the PNG into `public/assets/remy/` using
the exact filename (and set `kind: "image"`) — no other code change. **Rendering:** the app
renders Remy art ONLY through the centralized **`<Remy state="…">`** component
(`components/remy/Remy.tsx`) — the single, registry-driven, animation-ready render path;
never hardcode an `<img>`/`next/image` for Remy elsewhere. **Do NOT** re-introduce
master/production/archive sub-folders, hardcode an asset path outside the registry, or modify
`remy_master_v1.png`. See `public/assets/remy/README.md`.

**Remy is an application-wide PLATFORM SERVICE, not a page feature (authoritative, 2026-07-04 —
v2, supersedes v1):** Remy is a first-class capability like auth/analytics/theme/router. Pipeline:
`Public API → Event Bus → Brain → Emotion Engine → Policy Engine → Animation/Voice Engines →
Renderer`. **Features publish SEMANTIC EVENTS; the platform decides everything else** (feeling,
expression, visibility, animation, future voice). **The ONLY public import path is
`@/lib/remy`** — `Remy.emit("memory.saved")` (event bus), `Remy.enter/exit("offline")` (sticky
context), `<RemyStage context="memories.empty"/>` (in-place surface), `useRemyContext("…")`
(mount-scoped, leak-proof), plus `RemyProvider`/`RemyFloatingPresence` (mounted once by the app
shell) + semantic types. **Features must NEVER** import `lib/remy/core/*`, `lib/remy/companion/*`,
or `components/remy/{Remy,companion,platform}/*`, choose an expression, or reference an
`/assets/remy` path. The pipeline lives in **`lib/remy/core/*`** (pure TS, no React/DOM →
portable to native hosts): `event-bus`, `events` (+`CONTEXT_PRIORITY`), `brain` (semantic state;
future: memory/relationship/trust/personality), `emotion`+`emotion-engine` (feeling),
`policy-engine` (feeling→presentation — the SOLE presentation authority), `presentation` (the
expression vocabulary), `animation-engine` (over the `AnimationController` seam),
`voice-engine` (architecture only, no TTS). The React binding is `RemyProvider` (a thin adapter
over the core). **Exactly one** of each: public API (`lib/remy/index.ts`), renderer
(`components/remy/Remy.tsx`), provider, asset registry (`lib/remy/companion/asset-registry.ts`),
event bus, brain. **Allowed exception:** error boundaries (`app/error.tsx`, `app/(app)/error.tsx`)
render the raw `<Remy state="confused">` (the platform may be the crashed thing) — keep this list
tiny. To extend: add an event+feeling+look mapping and emit it; to animate/voice/go-native: swap
a backend behind its `create…` seam or write a new adapter+renderer over the same core — **never
touch features**. **Do NOT** create a second renderer/provider/registry/public-API/policy, put
business logic in the renderer/engines, or couple Remy to a page. (This is the **companion
platform** — distinct from the separate `lib/remy/*.ts` AI-intelligence layer and the frozen
`components/remy/avatar/*` sprite.) See `docs/architecture/REMY_PLATFORM_V2.md` (the single
source of truth; v1 `REMY_PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md` is historical).

**The Nest — Remy's living HOME, behaviour-driven (authoritative, 2026-07-09 — CORRECTS the
2026-07-08 hub; supersedes the Pass-1 `RemyActionButton` sheet):** the mobile center slot is
**"The Nest"** — Remy's persistent, alive, evolving HOME, NOT a FAB and NOT a menu button (the "+"
stays retired). **The interaction is the feature; the menu is a CONSEQUENCE of Remy greeting.** The
earlier hub was corrected because it still behaved like a prettier FAB (idle→tap→menu→close with a
`menuOpen` UI state). **The correction is BEHAVIOUR-driven and lives in the ONE Remy platform** — no
parallel system. **New platform layer (`lib/remy/core/`, exported via `@/lib/remy`):**
`behavior.ts` = the **behaviour vocabulary** `RemyBehavior` (resting/sleeping/idle/waking/peeking/
emerging/greeting/listening/thinking/searching/recording/celebrating/reminder/memoryFound/processing/
success/returningHome) + `BEHAVIOR_LOOK` mapping **each behaviour to an EXISTING
expression/emotion/animation-cue** (no new artwork) with a `presentsActions` flag; `nest.ts` = the
Nest **choreography** as platform data (`NEST_WAKE_SEQUENCE` waking→peeking→emerging→**greeting**
[sticky, `presentsActions`], `NEST_RETURN_SEQUENCE` returningHome→**resting**) **+ Nest EVOLUTION**
(`NestStage` small→growing→blooming→family→legendary + pure `resolveNestStage(memoryCount)`).
**Behaviour is a NEW platform layer above expression/emotion — this is the requested extension, not a
second brain/renderer/provider/registry/policy/event-bus** (the existing emotion pipeline + floating
presence are **byte-untouched**). **The nav surface (`components/navigation/nest/`) is a thin PLAYER:**
`use-nest-interaction.ts` schedules the platform choreography's timed beats (reduced-motion-safe:
jumps straight to greeting/resting; leak-proof `onBehaviorChange` seam — not wired), `Nest.tsx` renders
the behaviour-driven Remy via the **single `<Remy state>` renderer** (no hardcoded `<img>`) inside the
persistent stage-aware nest, `NestMenu.tsx` is the portaled sheet Remy presents **while greeting**. The
parallel `nest-state-machine.ts` (menuOpen states) and `nest-animations.ts` were **DELETED**. Default
state = Remy **asleep in the nest** (`resting`→`sleeping` expression + float + gold glow); tapping
**wakes** Remy who peeks, climbs out, greets, and only THEN presents 5 EXISTING routes — Ask Remy
(`/remy`), Add a memory (`/memories/new` via `MOBILE_NEW_ACTION.href`), Add a reminder (`/reminders`),
Search (`/search`), Insights (`/insights`) — each `withContext()`-threaded (care routing unchanged;
Search+Insights also stay in the "More" drawer). Choosing an action sends Remy **home** → resting.
The overlay is `createPortal(document.body)` (backdrop-blur containing-block invariant). **Future-ready
WITHOUT rewrite:** voice/AI/celebrations/memory-found/reminder/search/insights reactions, Golden
Feather, seasonal themes, Nest evolution, accessories, emotion, physical companion/Watch/Widgets/CarPlay
all wire in by TRIGGERING an existing reserved behaviour (or adding one row to `BEHAVIOR_LOOK`/a
choreography beat) + emitting a platform event — the reserved behaviours are defined+mapped but NOT
reachable from the tap flow, and **no deferred AI/voice/Rive/Lottie was built**. **Presentation +
routing ONLY** — billing/auth/caregiver+access_level/reconcile/reminders(scheduling/native/OneSignal)/
memory/search/workspace/active-profile all byte-unchanged; verified tsc/lint/build green + independent
adversarial review CLEAN (all 15 verdicts YES). **Known constraints (flagged):** the "Remy Design
Bible" is **not in the repo** (external — visuals scoped to existing approved assets + CSS), and the
Remy PNGs have **opaque backgrounds**, so the clean white `variant="nest"` pedestal is the nest vessel
and dedicated per-stage nest art awaits transparent assets (a future registry-only drop, no code
change). **Do NOT** reintroduce the "+" FAB, add a `menuOpen`/menu STATE (the menu derives from a
behaviour's `presentsActions`), fork a second renderer/provider/registry/brain/policy/event-bus, build
a second state machine in the nav layer, add a Remy expression/behaviour that isn't drawn through the
single `<Remy>` renderer, un-portal the sheet, drop `withContext`, or build the deferred live/AI content.

**The Nest — living-companion increment (authoritative, 2026-07-09 — extends the behaviour-driven
Nest; operator-approved override of the pre-launch companion deferral for THIS surface):** the Nest
was made to feel alive by EXTENDING the platform (not a redesign; backwards-compatible; single
`<Remy>` renderer + one platform preserved). **(1) Time-of-day is a platform layer**
(`lib/remy/core/time-of-day.ts`, exported via `@/lib/remy`: `TimeOfDay` morning/afternoon/evening/
night + `resolveTimeOfDay`/`isNightTime`/`greetingForTimeOfDay`) — computed **client-side after
mount** (SSR/hydration-safe) and refreshed every 10 min. It drives the Nest's ambient lighting
(warm by day, **moonlight cool at night**), Remy's resting look (**night→sleeping**, day→calm idle),
and a time-appropriate greeting. **(2) Nest evolution uses REAL memory counts** — 6 stages
**Tiny→Cozy→Family→Golden→Memory Tree→Sanctuary** (`lib/remy/core/nest.ts`); the count is a cheap
RLS-scoped head-count in the `(app)` layout (My Nest = null-profile/`user_id`; care = profile),
threaded `AppNavbar → MobileBottomNav → Nest` (degrades to 0 on error — never breaks the nav). **No
placeholder count.** **(3) Motion:** interaction motion uses **framer-motion**, centralized in
`components/remy/motion/primitives.tsx` (**no duplicated animation logic**) — the NestMenu now reads
as **Remy OFFERING actions** (backdrop fade → sheet spring-rise → Remy emerge → actions stagger in),
de-menu-ified; cheap infinite AMBIENT loops (glow / drifting motes / breathing) stay in **CSS**
(`nest.module.css`). All motion is **reduced-motion-safe** (framer-motion `useReducedMotion` +
CSS `@media`). Portal(document.body)/focus-trap/scroll-lock/routing/`?context=` all unchanged.
Verified: tsc/lint/build green. **STILL DEFERRED (blocked on assets NOT present in the repo):**
animated Remy character art (wings/blink/emerge via Rive/Lottie), dedicated per-stage nest artwork,
celebration character effects (feather/heart), achievements celebration art, emotion-specific
artwork, and real voice — do NOT fabricate these. **Do NOT** make `time-of-day` impure/SSR-time-read,
add a second renderer/state-machine, or move ambient infinite loops into framer-motion.

**Remy — app-wide companion presence (authoritative, 2026-07-09 — extends the ONE platform):** Remy
now reacts across the whole app via THREE surfaces mounted ONCE in the `(app)` shell (all render
`null` until Remy reacts; single `<Remy>` renderer + one event bus + one brain preserved — no second
AI/renderer/provider). **(1) `RemyScreenAwareness`** (`components/remy/platform/`) publishes a brief
arrival reaction per screen using a pure route→event map (`lib/remy/core/screen-behavior.ts`); new
`screen.*` events were added to the vocabulary (`events.ts` `RemyEventName` + `emotion-engine.ts`
`MOMENT_EMOTION`, mapping to EXISTING emotions — the documented extension recipe). Screens that emit
their own events (memories/search/remy/home) are omitted so Remy never double-reacts. **(2)
`RemyMilestones`** (`components/remy/companion/`) takes the REAL workspace `memoryCount` (already
computed in the `(app)` layout), compares it to a persisted last-count
(`lib/remy/companion/persistence.ts`), and emits `milestone.reached` on crossings
(`lib/remy/core/achievements.ts` — first/10/50/100/500/1000 + Nest stage-ups). **First-ever load only
BASELINES the count — never a retroactive celebration.** **(3) `RemyCelebration`** subscribes to the
bus and plays a centre-stage feather-burst + sparkles + heart through the single `<Remy>` renderer,
using the **real `goldenFeather` asset** — portaled, `pointer-events-none`, aria-live,
reduced-motion-safe. Reusable effects are centralized in `components/remy/effects/RemyEffects.tsx`
(framer-motion). **Event-bus invariant (authoritative):** the initial-mount replay buffer belongs to
the **Brain** (the first `{replay:true}` subscriber, via `RemyProvider`); ANY secondary bus listener
(e.g. `RemyCelebration`) MUST call `remyEventBus.subscribe(fn, { replay: false })` or it steals the
Brain's buffer and breaks cold-load context reactions (this was a real regression, caught by
adversarial review and fixed). **STILL DEFERRED (missing assets — do NOT fabricate):** animated Remy
character frames, per-stage nest artwork, real voice. **Do NOT** add a raw-bus subscriber without
`{ replay: false }`, fabricate celebrations for a not-real count, or fire milestones retroactively.

**Remy — Companion Intelligence (authoritative, 2026-07-09 — extends the ONE platform):** Remy now
notices meaningful things PROACTIVELY — behavioural intelligence, explicitly **NOT AI chat, NOT
notifications, NOT a poll/background job**. Two PURE core engines: **`lib/remy/core/insights-engine.ts`**
maps a `CompanionSnapshot` → behavioural `Observation[]` (greetings, first-visit-today, returning/
inactivity, reminders-due/all-completed/completed-count, memories-this-week/none-today, nest-evolved;
a birthday-tomorrow rule exists, data-wired when a source lands). **`lib/remy/core/priority-engine.ts`**
dedupes, drops observations still within cooldown, ranks (urgency→importance), and returns **AT MOST
ONE** — "one proactive behaviour at a time, no spam". BOTH engines are pure (no React/DOM/DB/timers/
clock — the caller supplies `now`). **`components/remy/companion/RemyMoments.tsx`** (mounted once in
the shell) runs the intelligence **exactly ONCE per app-open** (a `ran` ref guard; the shell persists
across navigations): a SINGLE read of the read-only, auth-gated, workspace-scoped snapshot loader
**`app/api/remy/companion-snapshot`** (memory/reminder head-counts; degrades to zeros; **never
polled**), then briefly shows one moment through the single `<Remy>` renderer (portaled,
`pointer-events-none` container + tap-to-dismiss chip, aria-live, reduced-motion-safe). **Behavioural
memory** lives in `lib/remy/companion/persistence.ts` (`CompanionMemory`: last-visit day → greeting
once/day + inactivity; acknowledged Nest stage → detect a fresh evolution; per-kind cooldowns → no
repeats). Extends the ONE platform only (single renderer + persistence + core engines + behaviour
vocabulary) — no second provider/bus/brain, no chat. Verified tsc/lint/build + adversarial review
CLEAN (12/12). **Do NOT** put a clock/DB call inside the engines, poll or cron the snapshot, add a
notifications/chat path, fabricate observations for absent data, or exceed one moment at a time.

**Remy — Living Relationship System (authoritative, 2026-07-09 — extends the ONE platform):** the
long-term counterpart to Companion Intelligence — Remy builds a relationship with the family over
time (behavioural, deterministic; **NOT AI/GPT, NOT chat, NOT notifications, NOT a poll**). **Six PURE
core engines** (`lib/remy/core/`, no React/DOM/DB/timers/clock — the caller supplies `today`/`now`):
`relationship-engine` (`RelationshipSnapshot` → warm long-term `RelationshipObservation[]`),
`story-engine` (`buildChapters` — life chapters INFERRED from decade + dominant category, **never
hardcoded**), `anniversary-engine` (`findAnniversaries` — **only real day-precision dates**),
`favourite-engine` (`rankFavouritePeople` — real `people.mention_count` + optional view/search),
`legacy-engine` (`buildLifeSummary` — timeline/chapters/key-people/major-events, **not AI**),
`legacy-export` (`buildLegacyExport` — a structured object for a FUTURE PDF/book, no rendering). Shared
types in `family-types.ts`. **`components/remy/companion/RemyRelationship.tsx`** (mounted once) runs
these **once per app-open** over the read-only, auth-gated, workspace-scoped
**`app/api/remy/relationship-snapshot`** (memories + `people` + dated memories, effective date =
`memory_date ?? created_at`; **never polled**; degrades to empty) and shows AT MOST ONE relationship
moment through the single `<Remy>` renderer. **Global coordination (LOCKED):** only ONE proactive
moment chip shows at a time — the shared **`RemyMomentChip`** (one impl for both surfaces), the
process-wide **`moment-gate`** mutex, and the single generic **`selectMoment<T extends RankableMoment>`**
(one selector for both). RemyRelationship yields to RemyMoments (longer delay + the gate). Relationship
memory (`persistence.ts` `RelationshipMemory`: cooldowns, acknowledged people-total/favourites/
anniversaries/chapters) persists so moments never repeat. Story/legacy engines are exported from
`@/lib/remy` for future timeline/legacy-book screens. Verified tsc/lint/build + adversarial review
CLEAN (14/14). **Do NOT** put a clock/DB in the engines, hardcode chapter names, fabricate dates/
people, add a second moment chip/selector/gate, poll the snapshot, or show two moments at once.

**Remy — Emotional Intelligence Engine (authoritative, 2026-07-09 — extends the ONE platform):** Remy
stops ranking memories by QUANTITY and starts understanding PEOPLE + emotional SIGNIFICANCE. **Three
PURE core engines** (`lib/remy/core/`, no React/DOM/DB/timers/clock): **`significance-engine`**
(`rankSignificantMemories` — ranks memories by significance, **NOT recency/creation-order**: signals
= people involved / favourite person / anniversary / chapter size / attachments / ai_importance /
revisits, + future-compatible pinned & conversation refs), **`emotional-engine`**
(`buildEmotionalProfile` → `EmotionalProfile`: most-significant person/memory, strongest chapter,
most-active relationship, most-revisited memory, most-emotional category, **+ four INTERNAL 0–100
scores** family-strength / life-continuity / relationship-health / memory-preservation), and
**`personality-engine`** (`derivePersonalityTraits` → behavioural TRAITS: family-historian /
memory-guardian / story-teller / legacy-builder / care-champion / photo-collector / daily-rememberer
/ occasional-visitor). **Remy NEVER exposes raw scores — only behaviours / observations / traits.**
`relationship-engine` now CONSUMES the `EmotionalProfile` (+ traits) via optional
`RelationshipSnapshot.emotionalProfile`/`personalityTraits` → 5 new observations ("…has become part
of your family's story", "X seems especially important", "…shaped much of your family's history",
"your family returns to this story often", "you've carefully protected these memories"). **FIXED
pipeline** (wired in `RemyRelationship`): snapshot → `buildChapters` → `rankFavouritePeople` →
`findAnniversaries` → `rankSignificantMemories` → `buildEmotionalProfile` → `derivePersonalityTraits`
→ `deriveRelationshipObservations` → `selectMoment` → the single `<Remy>` renderer. The relationship
snapshot loader (`app/api/remy/relationship-snapshot`) was enriched with REAL signals only —
`attachments` length, `ai_importance`, a `memory_person_links` join for people-per-memory, and a
`historical` flag (workspace-scoped + auth-gated; degrades to empty). Verified tsc/lint/build +
adversarial review CLEAN (12/12). **Do NOT** render a raw score, rank memories by recency, put a
clock/DB in these engines, or fabricate significance/traits from absent data.

**Remy — Memory Understanding Engine (authoritative, 2026-07-09 — extends the ONE platform):** a PURE
core engine (`lib/remy/core/memory-understanding-engine.ts`, `buildMemoryUnderstanding(DatedMemory[])
→ MemoryUnderstanding[]`) at the FRONT of the relationship pipeline (right after the snapshot). It
turns each REAL memory into a STRUCTURED semantic understanding — themes, life stage, importance
(ordinary/important/major/legacy), attachment/emotional/relationship richness, event type, time span,
a structured `MemoryRelationship` (primary/secondary people, participants, family-vs-individual), and
a 0–100 confidence — **deterministically, from the memory's own real fields only** (category, date,
`peopleIds`, `attachmentCount`, `importance`, `historical`). **NO GPT, NO prose/paragraphs, NO
fabricated facts.** Life stage + themes are inferred from real `ai_category` keywords with
`"unknown"`/`"other"` fallbacks (NOT age-mapped from a nonexistent birth date). It is **INTERNAL — not
shown in the UI**; it feeds the emotional/personality richness ratios today (`RemyRelationship`
derives `attachmentRatio`/`datedRatio` from it) and is exported from `@/lib/remy` as the input for
future engines. No snapshot/DB change (it reads the Phase-5-enriched `DatedMemory`). **FIXED pipeline
order:** snapshot → memory-understanding → story → favourite → anniversary → significance → emotional
→ personality → relationship → priority → one `<Remy>` renderer. Types
(`MemoryUnderstanding`/`MemoryTheme`/`LifeStage`/`MemoryImportance`/`MemoryRelationship`) are additive
in `family-types.ts`. Verified tsc/lint/build + adversarial review CLEAN (12/12). **Do NOT** surface
the understanding in the UI, generate prose from it, put a clock/DB in the engine, duplicate the
significance engine, or fabricate a life stage/theme/person from absent data.

**Remy — Memory Graph Engine (authoritative, 2026-07-09 — extends the ONE platform):** a PURE core
engine (`lib/remy/core/memory-graph-engine.ts`, `buildMemoryGraph(MemoryUnderstanding[]) →
MemoryGraph`) that understands how memories CONNECT — a deterministic semantic graph of nodes (one
per memory), edges (two memories that share a REAL attribute: `same-person`/`same-family`/
`same-theme`/`same-chapter`/`same-year`/`same-category`/`same-event`/`same-life-stage`, weighted by
fixed shared-attribute weights → `weak|moderate|strong`), and theme clusters (Family Memories /
Travel / School Years / Work Life / Medical Journey / Pet Memories / …). **Deterministic** (fixed
weights, stable sort by weight then id, `MIN_EDGE_WEIGHT` prune + `MAX_EDGES` cap), **real-data-only,
NO GPT, NO fabricated/guessed links.** INTERNAL — **not shown in the UI**; it sits after
memory-understanding in the pipeline, and its per-memory edge-degree feeds the significance engine
(more connected = more significant) via a CLEAN optional `SignificanceContext.connectionCountByMemoryId`
extension (additive; existing callers unaffected). No snapshot/DB change (it reads the
`MemoryUnderstanding` layer). **FIXED pipeline order:** snapshot → memory-understanding → memory-graph
→ story → favourite → anniversary → significance → emotional → personality → relationship → priority →
one `<Remy>` renderer. Types (`MemoryGraph`/`MemoryNode`/`MemoryEdge`/`MemoryEdgeType`/
`ConnectionStrength`/`MemoryCluster`) additive in `family-types.ts`; foundation for FUTURE
related-memories / journeys / semantic-search / reasoning. (Distinct from the separate, unrelated
`lib/remy/memory-graph.ts` AI-intelligence file.) Verified tsc/lint/build + adversarial review CLEAN
(12/12). **Do NOT** surface the graph in the UI, fabricate/guess links, put a clock/DB/randomness in
it, make edges non-deterministic, or duplicate the significance engine.

**Remy — Journey Engine (authoritative, 2026-07-09 — extends the ONE platform):** a PURE core engine
(`lib/remy/core/journey-engine.ts`, `buildJourneys({ understandings, graph, … }) → JourneyAnalysis`)
that understands COMPLETE LIFE JOURNEYS — a Journey is a structured collection of connected memories
representing ONE continuous part of a life (Childhood / School Years / University / Career / Family
Holidays / Medical Journey / Care Journey / Retirement / …). Journeys **emerge from REAL signals only**
(dominant theme + life stage + shared people + chronological continuity + graph connectivity): memories
are grouped by dominant theme, split into continuous segments by real year gaps (`> MAX_GAP_YEARS`, or a
chapter change with a smaller gap when chapters are supplied), and a segment below `MIN_JOURNEY_SIZE` (or
otherwise unconfident) is **left separate — never force-merged**. Each journey carries deterministic
`significance`/`continuity`/`importance` + a real `JourneyTimeline`; journeys link by real shared people/
theme (`JourneyConnection`). **Undated memories never fabricate a year** (`startYear/endYear = 0`); **NO
GPT, NO fabricated journeys/years/transitions/links** — deterministic (fixed weights, stable sorts, no
clock/randomness). INTERNAL — **not shown in the UI** (no JSX/chip/observation); it sits after
memory-graph in the pipeline, and its per-memory journey significance feeds the significance engine (more
journey-anchored = more significant) via a CLEAN optional `SignificanceContext.journeyImportanceByMemoryId`
extension (additive; existing callers unaffected → adds 0 when absent). **REQUIRED inputs = understanding +

OPTIONAL refinements (no-op today, forward-compatible — do NOT reorder the downstream pipeline to feed
them). No snapshot/DB change. **FIXED pipeline order:** snapshot → memory-understanding → memory-graph →

**Remy — Life Story Engine (authoritative, 2026-07-09 — extends the ONE platform):** a PURE core engine
(`lib/remy/core/life-story-engine.ts`, `buildLifeStory({ journeyAnalysis, graph?, understandings?,
chapters?, significantMemories? }) → LifeStoryAnalysis`) that assembles the canonical, structured
CHRONOLOGICAL life story from real journeys — the source for future AI conversation / biography /
timeline UI / story-book export / memory reconstruction / reasoning. **A Life Story is NOT generated
prose.** Journeys are chronologically ordered (undated last) then chained into **chapters** by
single-linkage: two adjacent journeys join **only** when their years are continuous (dated gap `≤
MAX_CHAPTER_GAP`; a dated gap `> MAX_HARD_GAP` **ALWAYS splits** — disconnected life periods are never
merged), their life stages are compatible, AND a REAL relational signal supports it (shared people /
journey-or-graph connection / same theme / shared life chapter). Chapters carry deterministic
`continuity`/`centrality`; the `timeline`/`milestones`/`summary` are structured references to EXISTING
journeys/years/memories only (titles reuse real journey titles; the story title is factual span
metadata — **no narration/paragraphs**). **Undated memories never fabricate a year** (`startYear/
endYear = 0`); **NO GPT, no invented chapters/years/events, no merged disconnected journeys** —
deterministic (stable sorts, no clock/randomness). INTERNAL — **not shown in the UI** (no JSX/chip/

**Remy — Reasoning Engine (authoritative, 2026-07-09 — extends the ONE platform):** a PURE core engine
(`lib/remy/core/reasoning-engine.ts`, `buildReasoning({ journeyAnalysis, lifeStory, graph,
understandings, …optional }) → ReasoningAnalysis`) that REASONS over the real journey/life-story/graph/
understanding layers to derive Remy's structural understanding OF a life — the foundation for future
reasoning / conversation / biography surfaces. Five structured products, all real-data-derived:
**Life Anchors** (dominant structural pillars — a theme with `≥ MIN_ANCHOR_MEMORIES` real
journey-memories; `"other"` is **never** an anchor; carries `strength` + real-signal `confidence`),
**Life Themes** (lifetime theme distribution + share), **Life Influences** (people with greatest real
influence — memory/journey counts + graph degree + optional favourite bonus), **Relationship Strengths**
(structured counts only — memory/journey/co-appearance, **NO emotional interpretation**), and **Memory
Gaps** (**FACTUAL only** — large year gaps, sparse / missing-between-present / weakly-documented life
stages; **NEVER a guess at WHY** — the `MemoryGap` type has no reason field). Everything is deterministic
(stable sorts with total-order tiebreakers, structural ids, no clock/randomness) and structured (all
scores are numbers — **no prose/narration**); **NO GPT, no fabricated anchors/people/dates/chronology,
no inference beyond the real data.** INTERNAL — **not shown in the UI** (no JSX/chip/observation); it sits

from the real journey/life-story/reasoning/graph/understanding layers — the foundation for a future
biography / story-book renderer that resolves the references to real data. **A Biography is NOT generated
prose.** **Sections** mirror the real life-story chapters 1:1 (id / title [**reuses the real chapter

and assembles the deterministic **PROVIDER REQUEST** a FUTURE provider adapter (OpenAI/Anthropic/…) would
send: **(1) the strict prompt** with the mandatory **PROMPT CONTRACT** embedded VERBATIM — "You are not
allowed to retrieve information / rank memories / infer new facts / change chronology; You must verbalize
ONLY the supplied ConversationComposition; Every factual statement must trace to supplied references; If
information is missing, do not invent it" — plus the structured composition serialization; **(2) citations**
(paragraph → sentence ids → reference ids → real entity ids, for traceability); **(3) provider metadata**
(provider [default `"deferred"`]/model/temperature); **(4) token** estimate (`ceil(prompt.length/4)`,

render-metadata / composition / hallucinate-facts / invent-references — every refId resolves from an EXISTING
`referencePlan`). **PROVIDER BOUNDARY / LLM RESPONSIBILITIES:** a real provider ADAPTER (the ONLY place a
`fetch`/network/LLM call may EVER live) is **NOT built** — a future phase plugs it in behind the provider
seam and fills `text`; the LLM may choose **WORDING** but NOT **content** (it may not change chronology /
importance / ordering / references / facts / memory-ids — the prompt contract enforces this).
**DETERMINISTIC vs NON-DETERMINISTIC BOUNDARY:** all inputs + this pure output are deterministic (structural
ids, ordered iteration, query-only Maps, `ceil` token estimate, no clock/randomness → byte-identical
output); the ONLY non-determinism (a future LLM's wording) is not present in this output (`text=""`).

NO fetch, NO SDK, NO async, NO network, NO wiring.** It creates ONLY the abstraction. Four PURE files:
**`conversation-provider.ts`** = the sole `ConversationProviderAdapter` interface (`generateConversation(request:
ConversationOutput): Promise<ConversationOutput>` + `configuration(): ProviderConfiguration` + `health():
ProviderHealth`; the provider layer may **ONLY** accept a `ConversationOutput` and return one — it MUST NOT
retrieve memories / rank / reason / score / plan / render / compose). **`provider-types.ts`** = `ProviderName`

`ProviderConfiguration` / `ProviderHealth` (+ `ProviderHealthStatus`) / `ProviderResult` / `ProviderLimits` /
`ProviderVersion`. **`provider-errors.ts`** = `ProviderErrorCode` + the throwable `ProviderError extends Error`
(code + provider) + `notImplementedError`. **`provider-registry.ts`** = a **deterministic** registry mapping

`configuration().implemented=false`, `health().status="unimplemented"`), plus `getConversationProvider` /

**Remy — Conversation Request/Response model (authoritative, 2026-07-10 — extends the ONE platform;
provider-request refactor):** a PURE ARCHITECTURAL REFACTOR (`lib/remy/core/conversation-request-engine.ts` +

"provider request" object carrying an empty `text` field (architecturally a REQUEST, not an OUTPUT) — into a
dedicated **`ConversationRequest`** (provider INPUT) + **`ConversationResponse`** (provider OUTPUT
foundation), BEFORE any real provider adapter is built. **`ConversationRequest`** = `prompt` (a structured
`ConversationPrompt` system/body/full with the 7-clause contract in `prompt.system`) + `contract`
(`ConversationContract` clauses + version) + `citations` (reused `ConversationCitation[]`) + `metadata`
(provider-agnostic controls: style/audience/intent/tone/verbosity) + `summary` (counts + prompt-token
estimate); **it MUST NOT contain generated text** (no `text` field). **`ConversationResponse`** = `text` +
`provider` + `model` + `usage` + `status` (`ConversationResponseStatus`: deferred/generated/failed) +
`citations` + `metadata`; **it MUST NOT contain the prompt** — intentionally minimal, filled by a FUTURE
provider (no engine produces it yet). `buildConversationRequest({ conversationComposition, conversationRender,
answerAssembly }) → ConversationRequest` is a PURE, deterministic transform that produces a
`ConversationRequest` ONLY (never a `ConversationResponse`), carrying the SAME deterministic request info the
verbalizer produces into the dedicated model (a migration-safe drop-in). It does **NO intelligence** (no
retrieval / ranking / chronology / reasoning / language-generation — pure serialization of the ordered plans;
every refId resolves from an EXISTING referencePlan; `answerSectionById.has(...)` only annotates
`source=assembly`, not a search/rank). Deterministic (ordered iteration; query-only Maps; `ceil` token
estimate; no clock/randomness → byte-identical output). **`ConversationOutput` (Phase 18) is RETAINED** for
backwards compatibility until a future migration phase. **NO provider/network/SDK/fetch/async/Promise, NO
wiring, NO UI, NO index.ts export, NO significance/intelligence change, NO existing engine modified** — the

**Remy — Conversation Provider Migration (authoritative, 2026-07-11 — extends the ONE platform;
provider-abstraction type-migration):** the conversation provider ABSTRACTION was migrated from the legacy
`ConversationOutput` request model to the canonical `ConversationRequest` → `ConversationResponse`
architecture. **PURE, types-only, behaviour-preserving; NO real provider implemented.** The
`ConversationProviderAdapter` interface method (`lib/remy/providers/conversation-provider.ts`) is now
`generateConversation(request: ConversationRequest): Promise<ConversationResponse>` (was `ConversationOutput
→ Promise<ConversationOutput>`). The `DeferredProvider` (`provider-registry.ts`) migrated to the same
signature and its **BODY is byte-unchanged** — still the synchronous `void request; throw
notImplementedError(this.name)` (NO async introduced — a `never`-typed throw satisfies the
`Promise<ConversationResponse>` return; execution model preserved; `configuration()`/`health()`/
`getConversationProvider`/`listProviders`/`isProviderImplemented` unchanged). **`ConversationOutput` is
`@deprecated` but RETAINED** (JSDoc pointing at `ConversationRequest`; its 5 fields byte-unchanged; a future
phase removes it) — the verbalizer (`buildConversationOutput`), `RemyRelationship`, the `index.ts`
re-export, and `provider-types.ts` `ProviderResult.output` still reference it and compile (the `@deprecated`
JSDoc adds NO lint warnings — `no-deprecated` isn't enabled). **NO network/SDK/fetch/async, NO wiring/UI/
index.ts change, NO significance/intelligence change, NO other engine modified.** Only 3 files changed
(`conversation-provider.ts`, `provider-registry.ts`, `family-types.ts`); the request/verbalizer/composer/
rendering/significance engines, `RemyRelationship`, `index.ts`, `provider-types.ts`, `provider-errors.ts`
are byte-unchanged. Verified tsc/lint/build + independent MULTI-AGENT adversarial review CLEAN (7 lenses —

purity / regressions / future-provider-readiness — **0 confirmed blocking**). **KNOWN FOLLOW-UP (pre-existing
from Phase 20, non-blocking, NOT introduced here):** `ConversationResponse.provider` /
`ConversationResponseMetadata.provider` are typed by `ConversationProvider` (family-types — 5 values:
deferred/openai/anthropic/azure/local) which DIVERGES from the registry's `ProviderName` (providers — 8
values: +gemini/azure-openai/ollama/lm-studio/custom-enterprise). A future real adapter for those 5 extra
providers cannot set `provider` from its own `name` without reconciling the two enums (it is LATENT — the
deferred stub only throws, never builds a `ConversationResponse`; baseline tsc clean). **The future
real-adapter phase MUST reconcile `ConversationProvider` ↔ `ProviderName` first** (out of scope here — would
require editing `provider-types.ts`, and this migration was restricted to the 3 files above). **Do NOT** make
the deferred provider return a value instead of throwing (behaviour must stay preserved) or become async,
implement a real provider here, re-add `ConversationOutput` as the provider input, or remove
`ConversationOutput` before the removal phase.

**Remy — OpenAI Provider Adapter (authoritative, 2026-07-11 — extends the ONE platform; the FIRST real

layer:** it receives the immutable `ConversationRequest` (built by the deterministic request engine), sends
`request.prompt.full` to OpenAI **EXACTLY as supplied** (a single `user` message — **NO rewriting / injecting
intelligence / reordering / enriching**), passes `request.citations` through **UNCHANGED**, and returns a
`ConversationResponse` (`text` / `provider:"openai"` / `model` / `usage` / `status:"generated"` / `citations`
/ `metadata`). It does **NO intelligence** (no retrieve/rank/reason/score/plan/render/compose/chronology) —
the deterministic Remy intelligence pipeline is entirely upstream and **UNCHANGED**. **The official OpenAI
SDK + network + env + async are ISOLATED inside `openai-provider.ts`** (the ONLY `"openai"` import in the
Remy provider layer; the OpenAI SDK was already a project dependency, used by `lib/openai.ts`/`app/api/
memory-chat` — **NO `package.json` change**). **Construction is side-effect-free** (constructor reads no env /
creates no client; `resolveApiKey`/`resolveModel` read `process.env.OPENAI_MODEL`/`OPENAI_API_KEY` lazily;
`new OpenAI({ apiKey })` is created inside `generateConversation`) so the registry stays deterministic and
makes NO network call at load. **Error handling:** missing `OPENAI_API_KEY` → `ProviderError("invalid-request")`
before any call; SDK/network failures are caught and converted via `toProviderError` (429→`rate-limited`,
≥500→`provider-failure`, else `invalid-request`; unknown→`provider-failure`) — **the raw SDK exception is
NEVER leaked** (a new generic-message `ProviderError` is thrown). **No retries/timeouts/fallbacks yet** (later
phases). **The adapter is DORMANT** — nothing in `app/`/`lib/`/`components/` outside the provider layer
invokes it (server-side, env-gated), so it changes **no runtime behaviour** of the app; it is infrastructure
ready for a FUTURE activation phase (activation — wiring a provider into a user-facing flow — is a SEPARATE
approved phase, NOT to be built without explicit approval). **Enum handling (no mapping layer):** the
response's `provider`/`metadata.provider` use the `ConversationProvider`-typed literal `PROVIDER_TAG =
"openai"` (`"openai"` ∈ BOTH the `ConversationProvider` [5-val] and `ProviderName` [8-val] unions); `this.name`
stays `ProviderName`. **Pre-work (enum unification):** investigated and **PRESERVED** the existing design —
full unification needs either a core→providers dependency inversion or a breaking change to
`ConversationProvider`'s members, neither "without changing public architecture"; OpenAI needs no unification,
and NO temporary mapping layer was introduced. **STILL-OPEN follow-up:** reconcile `ConversationProvider` ↔
`ProviderName` before a real adapter for gemini/azure-openai/ollama/lm-studio/custom-enterprise is built. Only
`provider-registry.ts` + the new `openai-provider.ts` changed; `family-types.ts` (`ConversationRequest`/
`ConversationResponse` unchanged), the request/verbalizer/composer/rendering/significance engines,
`RemyRelationship`, `index.ts`, `conversation-provider.ts`, `provider-types.ts`, `provider-errors.ts`, and
`package.json` are byte-unchanged; still exactly one `RemyMomentChip`. Verified tsc/lint/build + independent
MULTI-AGENT adversarial review CLEAN (7 lenses — provider-correctness / sdk-correctness / error-handling /
architecture-purity / regressions / platform-integrity / future-multi-provider-readiness — 0 findings). **Do
NOT** invoke this provider from RemyRelationship/UI/significance (activation is a future approved phase), add
intelligence/retrieval/ranking to the provider, rewrite/modify the prompt or citations, un-isolate the SDK
(network/SDK stays ONLY in `openai-provider.ts`), read env / create the client at construction, add a new
dependency, or leak SDK exceptions. **A second real adapter** (Anthropic/Gemini/…) implements the SAME
interface and must first reconcile the two provider-identifier enums.

**STILL POST-LAUNCH — DEFERRED, do NOT implement now (authoritative, 2026-06-28 — narrows the
blanket 2026-06-23 deferral to EXCLUDE the foundation above):** the Remy companion's
**CONTENT + behavior** — **real Rive/Lottie animations + final artwork, emotional reactions +
state transitions, live companion behavior, conversation UI, and AI connection** — plus
**Voice-recording memories, voice transcription, AI memory summaries, Semantic Search V2,
advanced AI memory intelligence**, and **audio / document / PDF uploads**. None of these are
started pre-launch. **Current priorities remain launch-only (1) Storage Subscription System →
(2) Media Expansion → (3) Productization → (4) Launch Readiness.**
**Reminders + push are production-stable and FROZEN** (reaffirmed): do not modify
reminder scheduling, push-notification delivery, OneSignal integration, iOS
notification permissions, or the notification infrastructure.
**Storage model (authoritative):** enforcement is by **TOTAL STORAGE USED PER USER**
(the purchased capacity), **NOT by individual file size**. The user *purchases storage
capacity*. At the limit: uploads are **blocked** → the usage UI reflects **full**
capacity → the **storage-upgrade modal** appears → the user is **directed to storage
plans**. **All future media types (audio/voice/documents/PDF) MUST reuse the same
byte-based storage-accounting architecture** (`storage_ledger` + `enforceUploadQuota`).
**Single source of truth (authoritative, 2026-06-23):** `subscription_plan →
BILLING_PLANS → storageGB → storage quota`. Storage is **bundled with subscription
tiers** (NOT standalone add-ons; do not create storage-only Stripe products). Launch
tiers: **FREE 1 GB · PREMIUM 25 GB · FAMILY 100 GB** (enterprise later). The limit comes
from `lib/billing/plans.ts` `storageGB`; `getStorageUsage` resolves the user's plan via
`resolveSubscription(profile)`. The **per-file 25 MB cap is REMOVED** — any supported
media size uploads as long as `used < plan_limit`; the only bounds are the Supabase
object size limit + the total quota. Do not reintroduce a per-file size gate.

## Mandatory documentation maintenance (Definition of Done)
A task is **not complete** until, in the **same commit**:
- `docs/handoffs/HANDOFF_CURRENT.md` is updated;
- the relevant `docs/features/*` is updated **if** architecture/behavior changed;
- `docs/roadmap/launch-roadmap.md` is updated **if** priorities changed.

**Documentation Maintenance Rule.** Any completed implementation that changes
**architecture · navigation · authentication · billing · database schema · AI
behavior · memory architecture · mobile behavior · deployment workflow ·
integrations · user-facing workflows** MUST, in the **same commit**, update **both**:
1. `docs/handoffs/HANDOFF_CURRENT.md`; **and**
2. **`CLAUDE.md`** — whenever the change establishes, retires, or supersedes an
   architectural decision or standard. Record it as **authoritative** (with a date)
   so future sessions don't re-investigate, re-litigate, or reintroduce it.

### HANDOFF_CURRENT.md must always contain
Current status · Completed work · Open issues · Active branch · Next priorities ·
Blockers · Recent commits.
